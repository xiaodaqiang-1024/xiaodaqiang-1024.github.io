以前就很喜欢的一首诗，不记得第一次从哪里看到了，但每逢站在人生的岔路口时，就会不知不觉想起这首诗。

《The Road Not Taken》

——Robert Frost

《未选择的路》

——罗伯特·弗罗斯特

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

黄色的树林里分出两条路

And sorry I could not travel both

可惜我不能同时去涉足

And be one traveler, long I stood

我在那路口久久伫立

And looked down one as far as I could

我向着一条路极目望去

To where it bent in the undergrowth.

直到它消失在丛林深处

Then took the other, as just as fair,

但我却选择了另外一条路

And having perhaps the better claim,

它荒草萋萋，十分幽寂

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

显得更诱人，更美丽

Though as for that the passing there

虽然在这条小路上

Had worn them really about the same.

很少留下旅人的足迹

And both that morning equally lay

那天清晨落叶满地

In leaves no step had trodden black.

两条路都未经脚印污染

Oh, I kept the first for another day!

呵，留下一条路等改日再见

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

但我知道路径延绵无尽头

I doubted if I should ever come back.

恐怕我难以再回返

I shall be telling this with a sigh

也许多少年后在某个地方

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

我将轻声叹息将往事回顾

Two roads diverged in a wood,and I—

一片树林里分出两条路

I took the one less traveled by,

而我选择了人迹更少的一条

And that has made all the difference.

从此决定了我一生的道路
